## Introduction
5S is a workplace organization method that uses a list of five Japanese words Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu and Shitsuke.

The list describes how to organize a workspace for efficiency and effectiveness by identifying and storing the items used, maintaining the area and items, and sustaining the new order. The decision-making process usually comes from a dialogue about standardization, which builds understanding among employees of how they should do the work.

Other than a specific stand-alone methodology, 5S is frequently viewed as an element of a broader construct known as visual control, visual workplace, or visual factory.
